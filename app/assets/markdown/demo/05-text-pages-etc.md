There are three kinds of pages you can use to create your book.

## Text Pages
Text Pages can be as long as you want. They're for long-form formatted text. Text Pages are formatted with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, a simple formatting tool for writing on the web.

## Section Pages
Books in Writebook have a flat structure, just like physical books. Insert a Section Page to designate a new part, section, or chapter; or for quotations or short bold statements.

## Picture Pages
Picture Pages hold a single, full-size individual image with an optional caption.
