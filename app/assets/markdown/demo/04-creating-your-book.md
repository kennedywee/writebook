# Creating your book

From the index of books, hit the green `+` button to make your first book. Fill out the title, optional subtitle, and author. You can also upload a cover image if you have one. Finally, if there are other people on your account you can choose who can read and who can edit your book with you. All of this can be changed later so don't sweat it if you don't have it all figured out yet.

## Managing pages
The table of contents is where you'll build the structure of your book. Think of it like a file manager where you can add [Text Pages, Section Pages, and Picture Pages](https://books.37signals.com/books/2/pages/28). If you're used to writing starting with an outline, you're going to love it.

The table of contents can be displayed at a list or as a grid of thumbnail representations of your pages.

You can also rearrange and remove pages here.
