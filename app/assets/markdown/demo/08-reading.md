# Reading

Clear typography that adapts to your device and screen size, a calm layout, and minimal distractions make reading a Writebook a pleasure. 

Here are a few more things you should know.

## Full Screen

For a more immersive, focused reading experience hit the expand button at the top of the screen to enter Full Screen mode (on supported devices). Full Screen hides most of the clutter and busyness of your browser and operating system so you can focus on reading. _Hint: you can use Full Screen while writing, too!_

## Moving between pages

As you reach the bottom of a page, you'll find a button with the title of the next page. Just hit it to continue. The back arrow button at the top of the screen moves back to the previous page.

On devices with a hardware keyboard attached you can also simply hit the arrow keys to move between pages. Just press  `→` to turn to the next page and `←` to go back. When you reach the end of the book, Writebook will return you to the table of contents.
